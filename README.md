# Reverse Integer Challenge 🔄

## Introduction 🚀

Welcome to the Reverse Integer Challenge! This coding problem, inspired by a [LeetCode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer), is a common interview question and a great exercise to test your problem-solving and coding skills. The goal is simple: given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse the digits of that integer.

## Problem Statement 📝

### Objective 🎯

Write a function that takes an integer as its input and returns the integer with its digits reversed. More details can be found on the [LeetCode problem page](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer).

### Constraints 🛑

- The input is a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should maintain the sign of the integer.
- If the reversed integer overflows (i.e., it's outside the range of a 32-bit signed integer), return 0.

### Examples 💡

1. Input: `123`
   Output: `321`

2. Input: `-123`
   Output: `-321`

3. Input: `120`
   Output: `21`

4. Input: `0`
   Output: `0`

## Requirements ✅

- The solution should be written in Programming Language of the Interiew.
- Your function should handle edge cases gracefully and efficiently.
- Unit tests are encouraged to verify the correctness of your solution. (optional)
